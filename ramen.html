    Originating in China, alkaline noodles served in soupy broth have been in Japan for well over a century, but like pizza in America, only became widespread after World War II. Troops returning from overseas had developed a taste for the stretchy noodles, and the inexpensive ingredients—wheat flour, bones, and vegetables—made them an attractive dish for restaurants to serve.
    <br>
    <br>
    Nowadays, ramen is high in the running for national dish of Japan. Museums have opened dedicated to its history. The instant ramen noodle was voted as the greatest Japanese export of the 20th century in a national poll. And, just as with pizza in the U.S., regional styles and specialties abound with soups, noodles, and toppings, all varied according to local tastes, ingredients, and cultures.

    Broth
    </h3>
    <p>
      You often see ramen categorized into four classes: shio (salt), shoyu (soy sauce), miso (fermented bean paste), and tonkotsu (pork), which doesn't make particular sense, as the first three are flavorings, while the fourth is the broth base. It's sort of like saying "there are four basic types of pizza: Neapolitan, Sicilian, New York, and pepperoni."
      <br>
      <br>
      While it's true that even in Japan, some folks see those four classes as distinct styles, there are plenty of cases where there are overlaps and outliers. For instance, what would you call a creamy, opaque, heavy ramen that's made entirely with chicken bones? It doesn't fall neatly into any of those categories, but it certainly exists.
      <br>
      <br>
      Instead, it makes much more sense to categorize ramen broth first by its <b>heaviness</b>, then by the <b>soup base ingredients</b>, and finally by the <b>seasoning source</b>. This classification system, used by some Japanese sources, can be combined to cover pretty much every bowl of soup-based ramen in existence.
    </p>
    <h3 class="rh header">
      Classification by Heaviness
    </h3>
    <img class="img" src="http://www.seriouseats.com/images/2012/09/20120921-223365-bestofjapan-ramenstreet.jpg">
    <p>
      Heaviness is classified as either <i>kotteri</i> (rich) or <i>assari</i> (light). Kotteri broths will be thick, sticky, and usually opaque, packed with emulsified fats, minerals, and proteins from long-boiled bones. Opaque white bone broths are also known by their transliterated Chinese name, <i>paitan</i>. Assari broths are clear and thin, usually flavored with more vegetables, fish, or bones cooked relatively briefly at a light simmer so as not to cloud the broth.
    </p>
    <h3 class="rh header">
      Classification by Broth Base
    </h3>

    <p>
      The <b>broth base</b> is the main ingredients simmered to make the soup. This can range from animal bones—pork, chicken, beef, and fresh fish being the most common—to even lighter broths made with sea kelp or or dried seafood. In addition to their main ingredient, ramen broths incorporate a variety of aromatics, such as charred onions, garlic, ginger, fresh scallions or leeks, and mushrooms.

    <p>
      The most widely recognized and celebrated broth worldwide these days is <i>tonkotsu</i>, a boiled pork bone broth. The best tonkotsu broths are a milky, golden color and leave a sticky sheen of gelatin on your lips as you slurp them.
    </p>
    <h3 class="rh header">
      Classification by Seasoning
    </h3>
    <p>
      The <b>seasoning</b> is the main salt source used to flavor the soup. It can be mixed directly into the soup base, but in many ramen shops, it's added to each individual bowl, making the menu a bit more customizable. The most common seasonings are:
    </p>
    <img class="img" src="http://www.seriouseats.com/images/2011/09/20110908-salt-shaker.jpg">
    <p>
      <b>Shio</b>: Sea salt is the oldest form of ramen seasoning, and derives from the original Chinese-style noodle soups. Shio ramen is popular in Hakodate, a southern city in the Hokkaido prefecture where strong Chinese ties influence local cuisine, but the weather is still mild enough for lighter, salt-based soups to flourish.
    </p>

    <srcipt src="index.js"></srcipt>
    <p>
      <b>Shoyu</b>: Japanese soy sauce is a popular ramen seasoning in the Kanto region of central Japan, originally emanating from Yokohama. Traditionally it's paired with clear to brown chicken, seafood, and occasionally pork or beef-based broths, though these days shoyu is used willy-nilly by ramen chefs throughout Japan. It's very common to see creamy tonkotsu pork broths flavored with shoyu, for instance.
    </p>
    <img class="img" src="http://www.seriouseats.com/images/2013/09/20130910-crispy-pork-miso-ramen-06.jpg">
    <p>
      <b>Miso</b>: Miso ramen is the youngest form of ramen, having gained popularity only in the mid 1960's and originating from Northen Hokkaido, where cold weather demanded a bolder, heartier bowl of soup. Its youth has not stymied its popularity, and it can now be found all over Japan and the rest of the ramen-eating world, most often paired with heavier, more robust, and unique toppings like sweet corn or stir-fried pork belly and bean sprouts.
      <br>
      <br>
      While in general, shio tends to be used to season ramen on the assari end of the scale and miso for the kotteri with shoyu somewhere in the middle, exceptions abound, and it's not uncommon to find rich bone broths flavored with plain salt or lighter seafood broths paired with miso.
      <br>
      <br>
      With these categories, we can classify pretty much any bowl of ramen we come across. For instance, the creamy chicken paitan ramen at New York's Totto Ramen would be considered a kotteri ramen made with a chicken broth base and flavored with shoyu, while the shio ramen at Yebisu would be an assari, sea-based broth flavored with salt.
