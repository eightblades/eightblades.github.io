  Asian Noodle Shoping Guide

<p>
  The world of Asian noodles is vast. Walk into any Asian market and you'll see aisles of noodles, each of different shapes, lengths, and textures. Noodles in Asia are more than a food—they're an essential part of culture with a 4,000 year history. Even the noodles' length has significance—they are often symbols of longevity in celebratory meals.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the amateur noodle shopper, parsing through a grocery's many noodle options can be mindboggling. Similar styles of noodles come packaged both soft and dried from China, Taiwan, and throughout South East Asia. The number of varieties alone are overwhelming, heightened by the absence of any standardized noodle nomenclature, language, or even common classification. This makes it difficult to know which noodles are which, and how to choose between them. So here's a guide to help you identify some of the most common noodles available in Asian groceries in the U.S.
</p>
<h3 class="nh header">
  Asian Noodles vs. Italian Pasta
</h3>
<p>
  
Though some varieties look similar, Asian noodles and Italian pasta have some important differences. Most pasta is designed to be cooked to the same al dente texture, but Asian noodles are different. Some are soft; others have a firm bite. Some are chewy; others, like ramen, have a more springy resistance to the teeth.
<br>
<br>
  Asian noodles can be made with rice, yam, and mung bean in addition to wheat flour, and even that wheat is a different variety than the durum wheat used in pasta. All of these differences in texture and flavor mean you usually can't substitute an Italian pasta for an Asian noodle.

  Finding Your Noodles
</h3>

<p>
  Most Asian markets group noodles by nationality: soba near udon and lo mein near misua. So think about the origins of the dish you plan to make, then seek out the corresponding country. But don't overthink it: many noodles are used in multiple cuisines, so you'll see repeats under different names. And remember, the hunt is half the fun!
</p>
<h3 class=" nh header">
  Storing Your Noodles
</h3>
<p>
  Most noodles in markets are sold dried, and they'll sit fine in a cool, dry place, though they can grow stale after a few months or so. Fresh noodles, such as Chinese egg or soft rice noodles, should be kept in their original packaging and refrigerated for no longer than a few days or a week, tops. (Though they're best fresh made on the same day if you can find them.)
</p>

  Cooking Your Noodles
</h3>

<p>
  As with Italian pasta, you don't want to overcook your noodles. Depending on thickness, soft wheat noodles rarely take more than three to five minutes to cook. Dried versions will take a little longer, but par-cooked noodles, like chow mein, only need reheating in a pot or pan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rice noodles cook even faster than wheat—they soften in less than a minute in boiling water. Mung bean and yam noodles also cook lightning fast, and you may not even need boiling water to cook them—hot water should be fine.
